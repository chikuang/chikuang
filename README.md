Hi, I am Chi-Kuang Yeh from [University of Waterloo](https://uwaterloo.ca/), Canada.

I did my [PhD](https://uwaterloo.ca/statistics-and-actuarial-science/) at the same institution and [MSc](https://www.uvic.ca/science/math-statistics/index.php) at [University of Victoria](https://www.uvic.ca) in statistics, and BSc in combined Mathematics and Statistics, also from UVic.

My hometown is Hsinchu & Taipei, Taiwan.

**Research interests**

I possess a wide range of interests, but for now, my research is centred around:

+ Functional data analysis, especially with dependence
+ Time series analysis
+ Dependence modelling (both spatial and temporal)
+ Optimal design of experiment
